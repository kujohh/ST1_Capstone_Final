#QUESTION 8
#producing a pairplot diagram to better visualise data and outliers#

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
df=pd.read_csv('gold_price.csv')
columns=['High','Low','Open','Close']
sns.pairplot(df[columns])
plt.show()

#Since the target is Close. Open, High and Low are the selected features#
#Volume will not be considered since it adds too much variation to the machine learning models#
